# Setup

Start with the raspiberry pi. There are two of them, only one of 
them is labeled. It has a piece tape on the bottom. Pair 
that with the printer that has a piece of tape on its bottom.

Take one of the jumper cables and plug it into the bottom right 
pin on the raspi. This is the 3v3 power pin and is pin 1 
on the pinout diagram.

Take another jumper and plug it into the 5th pin from the bottom,
on the left. This is pin 10 on the pinout diagram.

Screw both jumpers into the terminal as such.

This picture has jumper cables coming out of the other side
of the terminal, but these are the wires that you will probably
want to custom make.

These wires go to the wire leads on the cradle switch. 
It doesn't matter which way they are hooked up. Most likely you 
will want to take some of the wire I sent, cut a custom length
from where the switch is down to the pi, and solder the wire to
the switch leades.

Connect the phone to the raspi headphone output.

Connect the USB to USB type B cable to one of the USB ports on
the raspi.

Connect the raspi power supply. (Do not connect to wall
power yet)

Time to hook up the printer.

The back of the printer has the USB and power ports.

Connect the power supply.

Connect the USB cable.
![image info](./images/image_13.jpg)

Connect the wall power cable to the printer's power supply, and 
the other end to wall power. 
![image info](./images/image_14.jpg)

Connect the raspi to wall power.

The pi should turn on and the indicator lights should
look as they do below. It will take a few seconds to boot up.
![image info](./images/image_16.jpg)

The printer can now be powered on.
![image info](./images/image_17.jpg)

The program does not start until the cradle switch is depressed,
so that can be toggled now. If its already depressed because the
phone is in place, then it will skip this step.

Releasing and pressing the switch again will print the first image.
I'd suggest doing this a few times in a row to make sure all of
the brains are in place.

Sometimes when booting you'll get a page like this. Turn the printer
off and on again, then print several more pages. I've had to do
this several times before, but it has never not fixed itself
with some messing around with the power switch.

Here is the completed setup.
